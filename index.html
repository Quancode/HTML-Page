	        <p>
		    I have learned that if you want to follow your goals you have to be kind to yourself, and allow yourself to slip up sometimes. It's okay to make mistakes, because that's how you learn. 
		    </p>
            <p>The mental state can bring a lot of confusion, depression, fear and other emotions. <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">This can hold you back in achieving your goals big or small.</a> <br>
			By organizing your mind you can change your mindset helping you move forward mentally, physically, and spiritually.
